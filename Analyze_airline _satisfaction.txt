1. Create a data frame and display all the features and the target column.
2. Create a sample dataset with only specific columns, not all
3. Remove all objects having null or NA
4. Create test and training dataset and use decision tree to predict the class of unknown datasets
5. Display the accuracy. 
6. Calculate the precision and sensitivity with the help of your own code
7. Plot the tree
8. Convert any categorical attribute and assign codes
9. Apply Naïve Bayes to build the model
10. Compare the two results
